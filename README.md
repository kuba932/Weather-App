## General info
This simple app provides basic weather data to the user with only one screen.

Weather App constalty checks current device's location. If location status change, app passes new cordinates to OpenWeatherMap server via Retrofit and OpenWeaterhMap API to fetch latest statisitcs.

The user can also check weather in different cities after clicking on "hamburger" icon.
